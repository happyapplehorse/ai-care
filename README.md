# AI-Care

Current AI models are only capable of passively responding to user inquiries
and lack the ability to initiate conversations.
AI-Care endows AI with the capability to speak proactively.
With simple settings, AI-Care allows your AI to proactively care for you.

## Features

1. Low Cost: Whether in terms of token numbers or API call frequencies,
AI-Care strives to minimize these expenses. It has an O(0) order of cost consumption,
meaning costs do not increase linearly with the duration of activation.
2. Low Intrusiveness: AI-Care provides its services alongside existing systems,
with virtually zero intrusion into the original system's code.
This allows for easy integration of AI-Care services into existing systems.
3. Model Universality: Compatible with all LLM (Large Language Model) models,
AI-Care does not rely on function call features or specific ways in which the model is used.
